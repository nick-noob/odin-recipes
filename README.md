# odin-recipes

In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website in order to demonstrate the HTML knowledge I have acquired so far. 

The website will consist of a main index page, which will have links to a few recipes. 

The website overall will not look very pretty by the time I am finished. 

However, we will revisit this project once I have some CSS knowledge under my belt and make it look beautiful. 

Goodbye for now!
