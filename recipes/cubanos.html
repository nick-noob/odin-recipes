    <h3>
        Ingredients
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Unsalted butter, softened, to coat all sides</li>
        <li>2 loaves Cubano bread, sliced to form 4 sandwiches</li>
        <li>2 lb thin slices of boiled ham (<strong><em>not</em></strong> smoked)</li>
        <li>Yellow mustard, to coat</li>
        <li>4-6 dill pickles, thinly sliced lengthwise (about 0.25 inches thick)</li>
        <li>2-4 cups of mojo-braised pulled pork</li>
        <li>8 slices Swiss cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        _____________

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Butter the inside of each slice of Cubano bread with butter.</li>
        <ul>
        <li>In a large cold pan, place the bread buttered-side down over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Toast.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>While the bread toasts, in a separate medium pan, add a little butter and melt to coat the bottom.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Working a few slices at a time, sear the ham over medium-high heat, browning both sides.</li> <li>Set the ham to the side and keep warm.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Once the bread is toasted, generously coat the inside of each slice with yellow mustard.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>On the bottom slice of each sandwich, arrange the sliced pickles to cover, followed by a stacked layer of the seared ham.</li>
            <li>Add a layer of pulled pork, and top with a generous amount of Swiss cheese.</li>
            <li>Place the tops of the bread on the sandwiches.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Preheat a heavy cast-iron pan, which will be used to flatten the toasting sandwich. Generously coat the top and bottom of the sandwiches with butter.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Working in batches, in a medium, cold pan, place the sandwiches and set over medium heat.</li> 
            <li>Place the preheated heavy cast-iron pan on top to press into the bread. Toast the sandwich until the bottom is golden.</li>
            <li>Then flip it and place the cast-iron skillet back on top to toast the other side. (A panini press will also work just fine.) Repeat the process to make the other sandwiches.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Cut each sandwich on the diagonal into 2 pieces, and <strong><em>enjoy</em></strong>.</li>
    </ol>
