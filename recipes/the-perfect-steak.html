        Ingredients
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ribeye or New York strip steaks (1.25 to 1.5 inches thick)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2.5 tbsp (40mL) neutral-tasting oil</li>
        <li>4 tbsp (56g) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 bunch of thyme</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, skin-on and lightly crushed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat the steaks completely dry on all sides. Season the steaks very generously with salt and pepper. (Go a little heavier than normal; don't be shy!)</li>
        <li>Preheat a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil, and heat until extremely hot and nearly smoking.</li>
        <li>Carefully place 1 or 2 steaks in the pan, depending on their size; you want at least 1 inch of separation, so cook in batches as necessary:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Sear for 2 to 3 minutes, or until you get a deep brown crust on the bottom from edge to edge.</li>
            <li>Flip and sear for an additional 2 to 3 minutes</li>
            <li>If the steaks are the specified thickness, they should be very close to reaching medium rare at this point; if thicker, cook slightly longer.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>With the heat still on, add the butter, bunch of thyme, and garlic in the skins. Baste the steaks repeatedly until they reach medium-rare, an internal temperature of 132°F. (They will coast the rest of the way to 135°F, which is technically medium-rare.)</li>
        <li>Remove the steaks from the pan and let rest, uncovered, for 5 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>

        <strong>Enjoy!</strong>
